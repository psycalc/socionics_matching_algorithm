## Socionics Intertype Relationship Calculator

The Socionics Intertype Relationship Calculator is a Python script that allows users to calculate and explore the relationship between two socionic types based on the principles of Socionics. Socionics is a theory of personality types that describes how individuals interact and relate to each other.

### Requirements

2. `socionics_types.py`: This file contains abbreviations and names of different socionic personality types in multiple languages.

### How to Use

1. Ensure that you have the required files (`socionics_relationships.py` and `socionics_types.py`) in the same directory as the script.

2. Run the `intertype_relationship_calculator.py` script using Python (e.g., `python intertype_relationship_calculator.py`).

3. Choose your preferred language for the calculations by entering the corresponding abbreviation (en: English, es: Spanish, uk: Ukrainian).

4. Enter the abbreviations of two socionic types (e.g., 'SEI' or 'Mediator').

5. The calculator will display the relationship name and a description of the relationship between the two socionic types.

6. You can choose to calculate another relationship or exit the calculator.
